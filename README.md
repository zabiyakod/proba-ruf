The Ruffier's test (for DOS)

The Ruffier's test is a small physical test for a child, which allows you to establish the state of the heart. Only on the basis of Ruffier's test, children are divided into three health groups: basic, preparatory and special. It happens that, for health reasons, the child belongs to the main group, and according to the Ruffier's index, the heart may not be able to withstand the load, so he or she is assigned to the training group. Then the Ruffier's test is done again - after one to two months. The program is for DOS, but it also works under Windows. There are no viruses.

P1 heart rate in 15 seconds after a 5-minute rest in a sitting position
P2 heart rate for the first 15 seconds of the first minute of the recovery period
P3 heart rate for the last 15 seconds of the first minute of the recovery period

For normal operation, you need DosBox. Drag the file from the archive to the DosBox icon

Index value:
• less than 0 - athletic heart;
• from 0.1 to 5 - “excellent” a very good heart;
• from 5.1 to 10 - “good” good heart;
• from 10.1 to 15 - “satisfactory” moderate heart failure;
• from 15.1 to 20 - “bad” severe heart failure

Calculation example:
Adult man, 28 years old. P1 at rest before load = 20, P2 in the first 15 seconds after 30 squats = 25, P3 for 15 seconds after half a minute from the start of rest = 23. IR (Index) = {4 x (20 + 25 + 23) - 200} / 100 = 7 . Excellent heart function (normal).
